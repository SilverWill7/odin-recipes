    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Step 1</li>
            <p>Heat vegetable oil in a deep fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</p>
        <li>Step 2</li>
            <p>Whisk egg in large mixing bowl. Add chicken, salt, sugar, and pepper; mix well.</p>
            <p>Mix in cornstarch, a little bit at a time, until chicken is well coated.</p>
        <li>Step 3</li>
            <p>Working in batches, carefully drop one piece of chicken at a time into the hot oil.</p>
            <p>Fry until chicken turns golden brown and begins to float, about 3 minutes.</p>
            <p>Remove chicken to a plate and allow to cool as you fry the next batch.</p>
        <li>Step 4</li>
            <p>Once all of the chicken has been fried, refry the chicken, starting with the batch</p>
            <p>that was cooked first. Fry each batch until chicken turns deep golden brown,</p>
            <p>about 2 minutes more. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate.</p>
        <li>Step 5</li>
            <p>Prepare sauce: Heat vegetable oil in a wok or large skillet over high heat. Stir in</p>
            <p>green onion, garlic, whole chiles, and orange zest. Cook and stir until garlic</p>
            <p>turns golden and chiles brighten, 1 to 2 minutes.</p>
        <li>Step 6</li>
            <p>Add sugar, soy sauce, chicken broth, peanut oil, rice vinegar, sesame oil, and</p>
            <p>ginger; bring to a boil and cook for 3 minutes. Whisk 2 teaspoons of cornstarch</p>
            <p>in water until dissolved. Stir into the boiling sauce. Return to a boil and cook</p>
            <p>until the sauce thickens and is no longer cloudy from the cornstarch, about 1</p>
            <p>minute.</p>
        <li>Step 7</li>
            <p>Stir chicken into the boiling sauce. Reduce heat to low and cook until chicken is</p>
            <p>heated through and has absorbed some of the sauce, about 3 minutes.</p>
